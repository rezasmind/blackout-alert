# Installer Resources

This directory contains resources for the PowerGuard installer:

## Required Files

You need to add the following image files to this directory:

1. **Banner.bmp** (493 x 58 pixels) - Top banner for installer dialogs
2. **Dialog.bmp** (493 x 312 pixels) - Left side image for installer dialogs  
3. **Exclamation.ico** (32x32) - Warning icon
4. **Information.ico** (32x32) - Information icon
5. **New.ico** (16x16) - New folder icon
6. **Up.ico** (16x16) - Up arrow icon

## Creating the Images

You can create these images using any image editor. For a professional look:

- Use the PowerGuard color scheme (blue/green tones)
- Include the Persian text "محافظ برق" in the banner
- Keep the design clean and professional
- Use standard Windows installer styling

## Alternative

If you don't have custom images, the installer will use default WiX images, which will work fine but won't have the custom branding.
